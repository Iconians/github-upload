      <li>born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, Lika, Austrian Empire [now in Croatia]</li><br>
      <li>Tesla was from a family of Serbian origin. His father was an Orthodox priest;
        his mother was unschooled but highly intelligent. As he matured, he displayed 
        remarkable imagination and creativity as well as a poetic touch.
      </li><br>
      <li>
        Training for an engineering career, he attended the Technical University at 
        Graz, Austria, and the University of Prague. At Graz he first saw the Gramme dynamo, 
        which operated as a generator and, when reversed, became an electric motor, and he 
        conceived a way to use alternating current to advantage
      </li><br>
      <li>In 1882 Tesla went to work in Paris for the Continental Edison Company, and, while 
        on assignment to Strassburg in 1883, he constructed, after work hours, his first 
        induction motor.
      </li><br>
      <li>
        Tesla sailed for America in 1884, arriving in New York with four cents in his pocket, 
        a few of his own poems, and calculations for a flying machine. He first found employment 
        with Thomas Edison, but the two inventors were far apart in background and methods, and 
        their separation was inevitable.
      </li><br>
      <li>
        In May 1888 George Westinghouse, head of the Westinghouse Electric Company in Pittsburgh, 
        bought the patent rights to Tesla’s polyphase system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, 
        and motors. The transaction precipitated a titanic power struggle between Edison’s direct-current 
        systems and the Tesla-Westinghouse alternating-current approach, which eventually won out.
      </li><br>
      <li>
         He was often invited to lecture at home and abroad. The Tesla coil, which he invented in 1891, is 
        widely used today in radio and television sets and other electronic equipment. That year also marked 
        the date of Tesla’s U.S. citizenship.
      </li><br>
      <li>
        In 1898 Tesla announced his invention of a teleautomatic boat guided by remote control. When skepticism 
        was voiced, Tesla proved his claims for it before a crowd in Madison Square Garden.
      </li><br>
      <li>
        In Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he stayed from May 1899 until early 1900, Tesla made what he regarded
        as his most important discovery—terrestrial stationary waves. By this discovery he proved that Earth could 
        be used as a conductor and made to resonate at a certain electrical frequency. He also lit 200 lamps without 
        wires from a distance of 40 km (25 miles) 
      </li><br>
      <li>
        Returning to New York in 1900, Tesla began construction on Long Island of a wireless world broadcasting tower, 
        with $150,000 capital from the American financier J. Pierpont Morgan. Tesla claimed he secured the loan by assigning 
        51 percent of his patent rights of telephony and telegraphy to Morgan. He expected to provide worldwide communication 
        and to furnish facilities for sending pictures, messages, weather warnings, and stock reports. The project was abandoned 
        because of a financial panic, labour troubles, and Morgan’s withdrawal of support. It was Tesla’s greatest defeat.

      <li>Died Jan. 7, 1943, New York, N.Y., U.S.</li>
